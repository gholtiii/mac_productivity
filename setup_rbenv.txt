I've copied the contents of the URL locally here as I want to make sure I can always access it:
Install_Ruby_on_macos_using_rbenv.html

Next we want to make sure we've got virtual box and vagrant cli installed from vendor packages

For virtualbox:

Reference: https://cs.hofstra.edu/docs/pages/guides/vbox_mac.html
You can check for updates through the menu in the GUI among other ways

For vagrant:

George.Holt@GeorgeHolt ~ % vagrant version
Installed Version: 2.2.19
Latest Version: 2.2.19

You're running an up-to-date version of Vagrant!
