This document provides info on how I am managing Rbenv (ruby versions) on a Mac

References: https://www.thbe.org/posts/2021/03/18/Install_Ruby_on_macos_using_rbenv.html

I've copied the contents of the URL locally here as I want to make sure I can always access it:
Install_Ruby_on_macos_using_rbenv.html

Next we want to make sure we've got virtual box and vagrant cli installed from vendor packages

For virtualbox:

Reference: https://cs.hofstra.edu/docs/pages/guides/vbox_mac.html
You can check for updates through the menu in the GUI among other ways

For vagrant:

George.Holt@GeorgeHolt ~ % vagrant version
Installed Version: 2.2.19
Latest Version: 2.2.19

You're running an up-to-date version of Vagrant!
George.Holt@GeorgeHolt ~ %

Next make sure whatever shimmed version of ruby has the necessary gems:
gem install rubocop (or add to Gemfile)

----

Next make sure bundle install runs properly on the Gemfile

Next do the following:

```bash
brew install azure-cli
az login
```

# Vagrant

Use [https://github.com/chef/bento](https://github.com/chef/bento) to create the base box. That will create a `.box` file.

```
vagrant box add --name windows-2019 ./windows-2019-standard-virtualbox.box
```


I ran brew install for azure-cli and it upgraded my azure-cli and supporting environment to match the ruby 3.1.1 environment I was running under in rbenv - captured in azure_cli_upgrade.txt
